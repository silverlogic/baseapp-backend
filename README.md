## How to develop

Each module of baseapp-backend has a demo project in `testproject/` directory, which can be run as a standalone Django app to test. Then in baseapp-backend directory:

```bash
# Bring up docker containers
docker compose up -d --wait

# Enter db container
docker compose exec db bash

# Create 'backend' database
psql -U postgres -c 'create database backend;'

# Exit db container
exit

# Enter backend docker container
docker compose exec backend bash
```

If you're switching between projects and you want to wipe the DB you can do
```
psql -U postgres -c 'drop database backend;'
psql -U postgres -c 'create database backend;'
```

Run testproject inside the backend docker container:

```bash
# Install baseapp-backend's testproject dependencies
pip3 install -r testproject/requirements.txt

# Change folder to your app's testproject:
cd baseapp
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### How to develop with a specific project

Clone the repository inside your project's backend dir:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:silverlogic/baseapp-backend.git
```

And manually install the package:

```bash
pip install -e baseapp-backend
```

The `-e` flag will make it like any change you make in the cloned files will effect into the project, even with django's auto reload.

### Getting auto complete to work

Currently there's an issue with Pylance where it can't properly detect package installed in the editable mode with pip (eg. pip install -e ./baseapp-core)

To get around this, I've read online that adding `--config-settings editable_mode=strict` to each line of an editable install will work,
but I did not find that to be the case on my machine, instead I would recommend explicitly adding the package directories to the path for pylance

To do this, assuming you've opened the folder at the root of the repo, just add to your `.vscode/settings.json` file this
```
"python.analysis.extraPaths": [
    "./baseapp-auth",
    "./baseapp-blocks",
    "./baseapp-chats",
    "./baseapp-cloudflare-stream-field",
    "./baseapp-comments",
    "./baseapp-content-feed",
    "./baseapp-core",
    "./baseapp-drf-view-action-permissions",
    "./baseapp-e2e",
    "./baseapp-follows",
    "./baseapp-message-templates",
    "./baseapp-notifications",
    "./baseapp-pages",
    "./baseapp-payments",
    "./baseapp-profiles",
    "./baseapp-ratings",
    "./baseapp-reactions",
    "./baseapp-reports",
    "./baseapp-social-auth",
    "./baseapp-url-shortening",
]
```

### Testing

Running unit tests:

```bash
docker compose exec backend pytest baseapp_APPNAME/tests
```

### Implementation

The packages follow this structure for testing:

```
baseapp/
    manage.py
    testproject/
        settings.py
    baseapp_APPNAME/
        tests/
```

#### Minimum requires

- All app tests in `baseapp_APPNAME/tests` directory
- In the testproject dir:
  - Change the settings.py file to enable your app
    - Add your app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list
  - If your app needs a new dependency, add it to the "extras_require" of the main `setup.cfg`.
    - Change `testproject/requirements.txt` to include your new dependency from your "extras_require" using `pip install -e .[your_extra]`

## Publishing baseapp-backend package to pypi registry

To publish a new version to pypi you need to:

- update `version` in `setup.cfg` of the baseapp-backend package
- make sure that builds pass
- create a release on github
  - choose to create a new tag (named as `baseapp@v<version>` e.g. baseapp@v1.2.3), use the same version as in `setup.cfg`
  - use the same name for release title
  - optionally add changelog text
